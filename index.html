		<h1 class="my-title"><font color="red">BENEFITS OF OUR ROOFING</font></h1>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-4 col-xs-12">
				<h3>Durability</h3><br>
				<img src="101.jpg"><br><br>
				<p class="my-font-size2">Everyone wants a strong roof that can shield the family and the home from windblown debris and unfriendly weathers. Unfortunately, many roofing materials do not have the strength to withstand against aggressive wind and temperature change. Metal roofs, on the other hand, are fire-retardant and impervious to rust, mildew and mold. The wind warranty with this Canadian metal roof is 193 km/hr.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4 col-xs-12">
				<h3>Longevity</h3><br>
				<img src="102.jpg"><br><br>
				<p class="my-font-size2">The fact that metal roofs do not succumb to many of the common asphalt roof plagues makes them not only durable, but also lasting. ​This Metal Roof is built so well that the warranty lasts 50 years. You will see that it is not pro-rated so that it actually lasts. The Canadian Manufacturer has been in business since 1968.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4 col-xs-12">
				<h3>No Upkeep</h3><br>
				<img src="103.jpg"><br><br>
				<p class="my-font-size2">Maintenance on your part is virtually zero. Unlike other roofing materials, metal roofs do not absorb water and can rid snow easily from its surface. These two factors alone greatly reduce the chance of having a damaged roofing structure and gutter system.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-4 col-xs-12">
				<h3>Energy Efficiency</h3><br>
				<img src="104.jpg"><br><br>
				<p class="my-font-size2">Metal roofs have high solar reflectance and thermal emissivity, which means that they can efficiently reflect solar heat right back to the atmosphere. Depending on where you live, a metal roof can keep its surface approximately 100-degree Fahrenheit cooler than any conventional roof.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4 col-xs-12">
				<h3>Eco-friendly</h3><br>
				<img src="105.jpg"><br><br>
				<p class="my-font-size2">Unlike an asphalt shingle roof that needs to be replaced every 8 to 12 years, metal roofs can live beyond age 50 without any sign of decay. Additionally, metal roofs are 100 percent recyclable. Whereas more than 13 billion pounds of asphalt shingles lay uselessly in landfills, retired metal roofs are reused and contribute to at least 25 percent of a newly constructed metal roof.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4 col-xs-12">
				<h3>Resale Value</h3><br>
				<img src="106.jpg"><br><br>
				<p class="my-font-size2">Maintenance on your part is virtually zero. Unlike other roofing materials, metal roofs do not absorb water and can rid snow easily from its surface. These two factors alone greatly reduce the chance of having a damaged roofing structure and gutter system. </p>
